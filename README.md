- 👋 Hi, I’m @illi-noise
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about the various aspects of information technology, especially information security.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming with Python, building Linux and ethical hacking proficiency, and growing as an information security professional.
- 💞️ I want to be able to collaborate on simulation video games someday. I play a lot of them on Steam.
- 📫 How to reach me: through this platform!
- 😄 Pronouns: she/they
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have an all-white, blue-eyed husky who loves to howl at me with a lot of sass whenever I return home to her.
