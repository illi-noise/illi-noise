- 👋 Hi, I’m @illi-noise
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about the various aspects of information technology, especially information security.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming with Python, Linux proficiency, ethical hacking, and cybersecurity.
- 💞️ I want to be able to collaborate on simulation video games someday. For now, I research and experiment with hacking tools and scripts.
- 📫 How to reach me: through this platform!
- 😄 Pronouns: she/they
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have an all-white, blue-eyed husky who loves to howl at me with a lot of sass whenever I return home to her.
